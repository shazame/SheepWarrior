SheepWarrior
============

RobotWar project files for our team SheepWarrior.

The aim of this project is to build a sheep-shaped bot to compete in a contest called RobotWar.

Currently the sheep is being designed with Autodesk Inventor. Related files can be found in the folder called `Autodesk`. 

In order to have all the dependencies required to build the robot's Autodesk
Inventor Assembly, you need to run `git submodule update --init` after cloning
this repository.
